# Example Report 2

This is a placeholder for your second report page, demonstrating how multiple pages work together in an Observable Framework site.

## Overview

This page shows how you can structure multi-page documentation or report sites. Each page in the `src/` directory becomes a route in your published site.

## Data Integration

You can load data from various sources:

- CSV, JSON, or other data files
- Database queries
- API endpoints
- Data loaders written in any language

Observable Framework's data loader system makes it easy to work with data from anywhere.

## Collaboration

Observable Framework sites are just markdown files and code, which means:

- Easy version control with Git
- Straightforward collaboration workflows
- Simple deployment to static hosting
- PDF export for sharing offline

Replace this placeholder content with your own analysis, visualizations, and findings.
