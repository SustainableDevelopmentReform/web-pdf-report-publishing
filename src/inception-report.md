# Example Page 1

This is a minimal example page demonstrating basic Observable Framework features. **Replace this with your own content.**

## Overview

This example demonstrates:

- Markdown formatting and structure
- Table of contents (enabled via frontmatter)
- Footnote citations for academic-style references
- PDF export capabilities

Observable Framework makes it easy to create professional documentation and reports[^1].

## Content Structure

You can organize your content with standard markdown headings, lists, and formatting.

### Features

- **Simple markdown syntax**
- **Live preview** during development
- **Static generation** for fast loading
- **PDF export** with custom styling

### Example Table

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Markdown support | ✓ |
| Interactive JavaScript | ✓ |
| PDF export | ✓ |
| Footnotes | ✓ |

## Citations

When you need to cite sources, use markdown footnotes[^2]. They appear at the bottom of the page in both web and PDF versions.

Multiple citations can reference the same source[^1], and you can have as many as needed.

## Next Steps

1. Replace this content with your own
2. Add interactive visualizations with JavaScript code blocks
3. Configure PDF export settings in `pdf-export/config/config.json`
4. Build and deploy your site

See the [home page](./index) for more examples, or check the [README](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME#readme) for complete documentation.
