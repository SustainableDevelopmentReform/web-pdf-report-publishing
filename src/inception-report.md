# Example Report 1

This is a placeholder for your first report page. This example demonstrates basic Observable Framework features including markdown formatting, table of contents, and footnotes.

## Introduction

Observable Framework allows you to create rich, interactive reports that combine narrative text with live data visualizations[^1]. You can write in standard markdown while embedding JavaScript code for dynamic content.

## Key Features

Observable Framework provides several powerful capabilities:

- **Reactive programming** - Code cells automatically update when dependencies change
- **Data loaders** - Efficiently load and cache data from various sources
- **Beautiful defaults** - Professional styling out of the box
- **PDF export** - Convert your web pages to PDF with custom styling

## Example Content

This is where your content would go. You can include:

- Analysis and findings
- Data visualizations
- Tables and charts
- Images and diagrams

The PDF export system preserves your content's formatting while applying print-optimized styling.
